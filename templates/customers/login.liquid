  DESCRIPTION:
  The customers/login.liquid template is used by visitors to log in to their customer account page.

  DOCUMENTATION:
  https://help.shopify.com/en/themes/development/templates/customers-login

  ---

  NOTES:

  Common forms for this page include:
  {% form 'customer_login' %}
  {% form 'recover_customer_password' %}
  {% form 'create_customer' %}

  If customer accounts are optional, you can use a form with the parameter guest_login to allow the customer to check out as a guest instead of logging in to an account.

  {% if shop.checkout.guest_login %}
    {% form 'guest_login' %}
      <input type="submit" value="Continue as Guest" />
    {% endform %}
  {% endif %}
