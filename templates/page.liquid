  NOTES:

  Include {% layout 'alternate' %} at the beginning of a template file to use an alternate layout file from the Layout folder of your theme. This is great for building Microsite type pages. If you don't define an alternate layout, the theme.liquid template file is used by default:

  ex: Load the layout/full-width.liquid template:
  {% layout 'full-width' %}

  -

  If you want a template to use no layout file, you can specify none as the layout:

  Ex: Render the template file without using a layout:
  {% layout none %}
