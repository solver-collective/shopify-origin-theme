  DESCRIPTION:
  The gift_card.liquid file renders the gift card issued to a customer upon purchase. The URL to the gift_card.liquid template is found in email notifications sent to the customer when a gift card is purchased.

  Within the gift_card.liquid template, you can use the gift_card object's attributes to display a gift card's details.

  A default gift_card.liquid template is created automatically when the Gift Card feature is activated in a store.

  The Search Object:
  https://help.shopify.com/en/themes/liquid/objects/search

  * search.results_count
  * search.terms
  * search.types

  NOTES:

  The search.liquid template is not a required template.
  That search.liquid template is included in the current theme to make it easier for you 
  to customize your /search page.
  Whether you are using your own template for the search page or not,
  the {{ content_for_header }} tag in theme.liquid will always output the following on the /search page:
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="//cdn.shopify.com/s/global/search.css" type="text/css" />
  So the /search page is always styled by a globally-hosted stylesheet called search.css.
  You may override and complement that CSS in your theme's stylesheet.
  We are using a div#searchresults below so that the styles defined in search.css get
  applied to the elements on this page; the 'searchresults' id is used in the CSS
  selectors inside search.css.
